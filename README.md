# Programming Languages 

(currently being adapted from 2020 ... some links may be broken ... to run next time in Fall 2021)

You already know some programming languages (such as Python, Java, or C++) and you are able to teach yourself a new one. But did you ever wonder how to design your own programming language? How would you even get started on a project like this? 

After this course you should be able to develop your own small programming language. We will learn how to define the syntax of a programming language using a context-free grammar, how to use a parser generator and how to write an interpreter by recursion on abstract syntax.

- Our first programming language will just be high-school arithmetic and the interpreter will be a simple calculator. To appreciate that even this is not such an easy task, I invite you to implement a calculator in your favourite programming language before we start the course. (The challenge consists in extracting from the input string the relevant information about numbers, operations and order of operations. For example, as you will remember from high-school algebra, the order of the operations in the input string can be very different from the order in which the interpreter has to evaluate them.) 
- Our second example, will be the smallest proper programming language, lambda calculus. For this we will need to learn about variable binding and recursion. 
- Finally, we extend lambda calculus to a mixed-paradigm language including higher-order functions, recursion, assignments, loops, pointers, and arrays.

On the way, we will introduce various theoretical concepts that underpin Programming Languages and open windows to topics in programming languages research.

We will also have the opportunity to touch on philosophical questions such as "What is Computation?", "What is Meaning?", "What is Information?", "What is an Algorithm?" and discuss whether it is possible to give a precise and satisfactory answer.

## Other Courses on Programming Languages

  - [Programming Languages](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/PL/html/#). This course follows a similar outline. Chapters 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1-3.4, 3.6, 3.9 could be a useful second reference for this course. The **online exercises** may also be valuable, let me know if you try them. Chapter 4 corresponds to LambdaNat and Chapter 5 to LambdaFun but the details are quite different. We only touch upon Chapter 6, so that could be further reading. Chapter 7 on Type Systems is a topic we will study in our course on Compiler Construction. 

  - [Notes on Programming Paradigms](https://tgdwyer.github.io/). A course that shares many aims and methods with this one. I just browsed over the content, but it looks promising ... recommended if you want to have a different point of view on the same general topic.


## "Must Reads"

I list some books that stood the test of time and are less technical and of wider interest, more foundational than practical. Not required reading, but great background if you like to read widely.

- Hofstadter: [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). A wide ranging book bringing together history, art, music and computer science. Contains a lot of rewriting and computability theory. The reader ends up with a proof of Goedel's incompleteness theorem, without going through a technical and advanced course of logic.

- Smullyan: [To Mock a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird). Presents a deep but playful account of combinatory logic and the lambda-calculus. Entirely formulated as a sequence of logic puzzles that should be accessible to everybody with a taste for these kind of mind teasers. If you do, also check out other books by Smullyan.

- Petzold: [The Annotated Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Annotated_Turing). Goes through Turing's famous paper line by line. Can be read from a technical point of view, but one can also browse it lightly and just pick out the anecdotes.

- Doxiadis, Papadimitriou: [Logicomix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix). This graphical novel about the life of Bertrand Russell introduces many of the main players in the history of logic and computing in the early 19 hundreds. Co-authored by one of the most influential contemporary theoretical computer scientists.

... I'd be curious to learn about your favourites ...

## Early History of Programming Languages

(for those with an interest in history and/or philosophy)

The early history of programming languages was driven by mathematicians, logicians and philosophers. A great way to explore it is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP). I link articles that feature some of the early researchers in programming language who will appear in our course such as Church, Turing, and Curry and logicians and mathematicians for whom we do not have time such as Dedekind, Peano, Russell, Hilbert, Brouwer, Goedel, Gentzen. The articles can get quite technical but just reading the introductions gives an idea of the broader questions and developments. A nice project could be to arrange the topics and protagonists of these articles into a timeline and then sketch a short history of the most important ideas and how they hang together.

- [The Modern History of Computing](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/)  
- [Dedekind](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dedekind-foundations/) and [The Early Development of Set Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/settheory-early/)

Get in touch if you want to hear more about how these articles are related to this course.

Our course will explore the ramifications of these early developments in the area of programming languages, in particular with respect to designing programming languages and building interpreters. Another important area of theoretical computer science branching off from the early fundamentamental [^typo] discoveries of Turing and others is computational complexity theory and I recommend [Chapter 2 of the book Mathematics and Computation](https://www.math.ias.edu/files/Book-online-Aug0619.pdf#page=1) for a first introduction. While the vast majority of this book is outside the scope of this course, this chapter illustrates well that programming languages and complexity theory flow from the same spring.

I recently became more interested in the **history of variable binding**. In programming, variable binding and capture avoiding substitution was introduced in Church's lambda calculus.  It forms the basis of concepts such as function, method, procedure, scope, local vs global variables, objects and classes, interfaces, etc. In logic, variable binding appears as quantification. A good starting point for the history of quantifiers is Putnam's [Peirce the Logician](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82687196.pdf). We will touch on the importance of quantifiers for computing in a lecture on [capture avoiding substitution](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SkQzDC6n7#A-programming-example). 


[^typo]: I like this typo too much to correct it ... apologies.

## Modern History of Programming Languages

I would let the modern history of programming languages begin with Fortran and Lisp. Until approximately 1970 it was dominated by the problem of writing efficient parsers and compilers. By 1980, parsing and compiling was well understood and software engineering was born. We will have more time for this part of the history next semester in Compiler Construction. The discussion topics below mostly aim at current developments in programming languages.

## Discussion Topics 

#### New for 2021:

- [We need a safer systems programming language](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/). Quote: "*whenever possible software should eventually be moved to a completely memory-safe language [...] If there are legitimate reasons for needing the speed, control and predictability of a language like C++, see if you can move to a systems-level programming language that is memory safe*". The next post advertising Rust is also interesting. If you want to see how these problems inspire current research in programming languages look for example at [Project Verona](https://github.com/microsoft/verona/blob/master/docs/faq.md).
(Btw, I found this article linked in a [blog by Edward Snowden](https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/ns-oh-god-how-is-this-legal)  who is always worth reading when it comes to the topics of privacy, surveillence and security.)
- [10 Papers Every Developer Should Read](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/10-papers-every-developer-should-read-at-least-twice) ... these papers could make an interesting discussion.

#### From 2020 (but still of interest):

None of this is required reading, but all of it is part of the wider landscape in which this course is situated. Many of these links are to talks, videos, articles and blogs that do not represent carefully researched peer-reviewed authoritative expert consensus. Do not take opinions for granted but as an invitation to start a discussion.

(And thanks to everybody who contributed links.)

- [AsciiDots](https://esolangs.org/wiki/AsciiDots). "AsciiDots is an esoteric programming language based on ascii art." I didn't look into this but I like the idea of developing small programming languages not so much for a practical purpose but rather as a computer-art project. Any ideas? Get in touch ...

- [Contravariant logging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzOQOmmkKEM&list=PLxxF72uPfQVTfDksvV4KPV5CxKnf0d_X3#t=25m20s). Logging can be pain ("low to weight ratio"). Starting at 25:23, this talk explains how to do logging with a minimal interface. The basic explanation of how to do "simple oneline tracing" is finished by 31:47. 

- Why does GoLang have objects but no inheritance?

- What makes a programming language successful? This question is discussed in the video [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4) He concludes with several arguments why FP might be the norm in the future for example searching for books on ["functional programming in"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22functional+programming+in%22&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) suggests that many imperative and OO languages are keen on jumping on the FP train. What do you think?

- Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) play an increasing role in industry. Haskell is a good language to develop DSLs. For an example see [Ivory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaloisInc/smaccmpilot-experiencereport/master/embedded-experience.pdf).

- The [No-Code Software Revolution](https://medium.com/inc./welcome-to-the-no-code-software-revolution-6b75ee967df7). Will building apps without writing code change what we understand by "programming language"?

- [rise4fun](https://rise4fun.com/) has a long list of **software engineering tools** for program analysis and verification that you can run in your webbrowser.

- **Unison** is a new programming language based on the idea of [content-addressed code](https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/tour). Search the linked tour for "functional" to see why it is important for Unison to be a pure functional programming language. I only worked through the tour sofar, but it looks very interesting.

- Charles Scalfani on Haskell: He writes from the point of view of a software engineer who had to learn Haskell the hard way. I first came across his article [Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53#.p6vn7xvdj). His [more recent articles](https://medium.com/@cscalfani) contain more lessons about how and why to learn Haskell. Could be a starting point to assess how the pros and cons of different programming languages and paradigms are discussed by software developpers. 

- Terence Tao: [Compactness and contradiction](https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/blog-book.pdf). Tao is one of the leading mathematicians of his generation. Nevertheless, Chapter 1 on "Logic and foundations" of this book is quite accessible to a reader with background in computing and/or logic and it touches on many topics that crop up in this course. Highly recommended to everybody with a taste for mathematics. I found Sections 1.11 about vagueness and 1.12 about a computational perspective on set theory particularly insightful. Section 1.4 on "Stable implications" is closely related to a favourite topic of mine, namely "Mathematics as a programming language".

- [Turing Incomplete Languages](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/11/turing-incomplete-languages.html). This blog illustrates a general topic: If you want a language that can express important ideas easily, you can also use this language to express rubbish easily. If you want to limit language so that it becomes impossible to express rubbish, good ideas become also more difficult to express. And then, after a while, you notice that you can still write rubbish in the restricted language anyway. (Sam Griffin in the comments has a more nuanced view on this.) So you end up making the language expressive again (unless there is a specific technical reason not to do so, such as efficient automatization (see also the last sentence of Chapter 1 of Tao's book referenced above)). Btw, in this context one should recall Turing's theorem: Every language that allows us to express all terminating programs must necessarily allow us to write non-terminating programs. One thing one should add to the article (but see the comments), is that there are actually languages, known as type theories, with powerful recursion principles in which all programmable functions do terminate. 

- **Programming Languages for Data Science and AI:**   
  - [Programmatically interpretable reinforcement learning](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/15/programmatically-interpretable-reinforcement-learning/). The main idea is to improve interpretability by learning expressions in a domain specific language representing expert knowledge. Could that be combined with theorem proving as in the approach of [Ganesalingam and Gowers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4501.pdf)?
  - Differential Programming and Probabilistic Programming Languages are two quickly growing fields. I plan to add references over time (but I might forget):
    - Conal Elliott investigate in [Efficient automatic differentiation made easy via category theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17gfCTnw6uE) whether **differentiation of functions can be added  as an operation to functional programming languages such as Haskell**. In [A Functional Reboot for Deep Learning](https://github.com/conal/talk-2018-deep-learning-rebooted#readme) he goes further and argues that we should program machine learning algorithms in a programming language that does have differentiation but *hides neural networks, layers, and backpropagation as implementation details*. This might allow us, for example, to use a larger variety of functions for learning and thus reduce the complexity of the neural networks. A hint at the technicalities is given after [23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns3DxUeCvRg#t=23m45s).
    - Vakar, Kammar, Staton: [A Domain Theory for Statistical Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04196.pdf). We do not cover enough theory in the course to understand this paper. But reading the introduction shows that the basic principles we will learn about underpin cutting edge research on novel programming languages that allows us not just to do numerical calculations and simulations but to **directly build and manipulate the underlying statistical models**. 

- Video: [Modelling Pandemics in Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zr2qnud4XM&feature=youtu.be) features many of the topics that appear in our course. 


- [Lego Turing Machine](https://vimeo.com/44202270)

- **Multi-Paradigm Languages**: 
  - [Julia](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-julia-programming-language/) may well be on the way to replace Python as the language for scientific computing. 
  - [Scala](https://data-flair.training/blogs/why-scala/) continues the success of Java but adds FP features such as higher-order functions, algebraic data types and pattern matching. 
  -  [Rust]() builds on the success of C, but adds features of modern languages including FP. Rust's concept of [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html) strikes a balance between C-style memory allocation and Java-style garbage collection. This ideas is related to [linear type systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09756). For more on how Rust combines imperative with functional features see eg the blog [Is Rust a functional programming language?](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional/).

- Comparing different programming paradigms. There is a raging debate about the pros and cons of different programming paradigms. Reading widely to get a lot of different views is recommended. Often the comments are the most interesting part. Here are some entry points. [Was object-oriented programming a failure?](https://www.quora.com/Was-object-oriented-programming-a-failure/answer/Michael-O-Church?srid=wk4L) ...

- [Compiling Lisp to JavaScript From Scratch in 350 LOC](https://gilmi.xyz/blog/post/2016/10/14/lisp-to-js) 

## Pioneers of Programming Languages 

(send me your favourite links to add):

  - Documentary about [John von Neumann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2jiQXI6nrE) containing footage of the computer JvN had built in the 1940ies. [Adventures of a Mathematician](https://archive.org/details/adventuresofmath0000ulam) is a wonderful book about JvN by Stan Ulam, himself a legendary mathematician.

  - Robin Milner. [Turing Award Lecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/151233.151240).
  - [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey), the creator of Clojure, says "State is Never Simple" in [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) at 31m35s and following. The morale is: It is easier not to complect if coding in a functional language. Memorable quotes: "By stateful I mean that every time you ask the same question you get a different answer." "I don't know,I don't want to know." "Represent data by data." "Easy is not simple."

  - [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup), the creator of C++, talks about [The Essence of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86xWVb4XIyE&feature=emb_rel_err). Historically interesting is also his talk about [The Design of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69edOm889V4) from 1994.

  - [Simon Peyton Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones), one of the inventors of Haskell, talks about [Functional Programming Languages and the Pursuit of Laziness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqWDAo1Jnyc). 

  - [Bob Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin), one of the inventors of agile computing talks about the [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc).

  - [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), one of the inventors of personal computing and object-oriented programming, talks about how the invention of personal computing goes back to a project of reforming school education in [Inventing the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ZHxUwqPVw). "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
  - [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare): 
    - [1980 Turing Award Lecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283936) has a lot of interesting anecdotes about Quicksort, Algol, the switch statement, early compilers, operating systems, Hoare logic. Also some valuable general lessons about software engineering. I collected some of my [favourite quotes](hoare-1980-quotes.md).

    - Video: [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/) 2009. picks up some of the same themes, but focuses on pointers and memory management, on compile-time vs run-time. "I don't care about the subscript error, I want it to run." (18:00).The discussion around (24:27) about disjoint unions is related to `Maybe` in Haskell and then to abstract syntax trees. Difficulty of proofs of program correctness as an objective measure of the quality of a program language (32:32). Programming language design is driven by the need to fight viruses (37:40). "The virus will find a case that is not likely to arise". "If it hadn't been for the get routine of C, we might have had no malware". (39:25).

  -  The [ACM Turing Award Winner Interview Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0nrSd4xjjaSLBSzmno-3Ods6FJE9nlO) has some great interviews ... I wish I had found the time to watch them all. 

## Acknowledgements

This course has been developed by Alexander Kurz and Samuel Balco for the students of Chapman University and is taught by Alexander Kurz. 

The specific way we intertwine theory and practice may be original, but we build on a long tradition of teaching courses on  principles of programming languages. The idea that the best way to understand how programming languages work under the hood is to learn how to build your own, goes back at least to the MIT course/"Wizard Book" by Abelson and Sussman, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), which is still worth reading today. Our use of the parser generator BNFC for the language `LambdaNat` follows Aarne Ranta's book [Implementing Programming Langugages](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book), which forms the basis for the [Programming Language Technology](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/DAT151/) course at Chalmers University. We will hear more about this in our course on Compiler Construction next semester. `LambdaNat` itself is a lambda calculus with just enough additional "syntactic sugar" so that writing programs in `LambdaNat` allows us to do simple mainstream functional programming. The way we then extend `LambdaNat` to our second language, `LambdaFun`, by adding while loops, memory allocation, assignment, and pointers is inspired by Michael Spivey's course on [Programming Languages](https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Welcome_to_Spivey%27s_Corner) at Oxford University.

I am also grateful to my friends and colleagues from the [Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/) who have influenced with their graduate level courses from 2002 onwards the choice of material. In fact, it is one of the aims of this course to provide at the undergraduate level the foundations that will equip interested students with the knowledge needed to study more advanced topics in programming languages. Many of the paragraphs labelled "Further Study'' are meant to provide bridges to such graduate level courses.

Many thanks to all with whom I had the opportunity to discuss the contents of the course, including (but not limited to) Roy Crole,  Peter Jipsen, Drew Moshier, Paula Severi, and Fer-Jan de Vries; to all the colleagues from whom I have been learning over the years; and, most of all, to the students of 2018/19/20 for continuing challenge and feedback: 2018 was a theory course, 2019 added the interpreters, 2020 added more on Haskell and 2021 will be different again (the overlap between 2018 and 2020 was just 4 weeks of material: Lambda Calculus, Rewriting and Hoare Logic).
